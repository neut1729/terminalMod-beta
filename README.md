# terminalMod-beta
Open source code of the [terminalMod beta](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3626127801) (name is a wip).

Very barebones right now but i've decided to open-source it already so any suggested structure changes can still be easily implemented.
This is quite literally the first thing i've written in lua so don't be too mean please. :p

Will probably rerelease as a full version when it's in a later stage.
